# Heart-Disease-Prediction

Heart disease prediction using logistic regression is a data-driven approach to assess the probability of an individual developing heart disease. The model utilizes a dataset containing information such as age, gender, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other relevant medical factors as independent variables. Logistic regression, a statistical technique suited for binary classification tasks, is employed to train the model on historical data where the presence or absence of heart disease serves as the target variable (dependent variable).

**Process:**

**Data Collection:** Relevant medical data is collected from individuals, including both those with and without heart disease.

**Data Preprocessing:** The collected data undergoes preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, normalization, and encoding categorical variables.

**Feature Selection:** Important features that significantly impact heart disease prediction are selected through techniques like correlation analysis or domain knowledge.

**Model Training:** Logistic regression is applied to the processed data to build a predictive model. During training, the model learns the relationship between input features and the probability of heart disease occurrence.

**Model Evaluation:** The trained model is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC curves to assess its predictive performance.

**Prediction:** Once validated, the model can be deployed to predict the likelihood of heart disease in new individuals based on their medical information.

**Outcome:**

Heart disease prediction using logistic regression provides a tool for early detection and risk assessment, aiding healthcare professionals in making informed decisions regarding patient care and preventive measures.
